#List Index 
#We can access list items by using its index with the square bracket syntax []. 
#For example names[1] will give "OM", names[3] will give "Ankit" and so on...
names = ["Aman", "OM", "Riyaz", "Ankit", "Aadarsha"]
print(names[0])
print(names[2])
print(names[4])    
'''(This is the example of positive indexing)'''    

#For Negative Indexing
#Similar to positive indexing, negative indexing is also used to access items, 
#but from the end of the list.
#The last item has index [-1], second last item has index [-2], 
#third last item has index [-3] and so on.

names = ["Aman", "OM", "Riyaz", "Ankit", "Aadarsha"]
#          
print(names[-2])
print(names[-4])
print(names[-3])
